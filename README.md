# AT_library
Simple web application using Flask and Vue.

This project is based on a tutorial of testdrive.io [flask-vue-crud](https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-flask-and-vuejs/).
I used the tutorial to start my project and from that I created my updates and changes. My intentions are for studies only.

# How to run the project

### Flask section
Open a new terminal. In the server folder, activate flask:

> $ source env/bin/activate

The virtual environment should turn on and the terminal will be like this:

> (env)$

Then, run the app:

> (env)$ python app.py

To test if the app is working fine, point your browser at http://localhost:5000/ping. You should see:

> "pong!"

### Vue section

Open a new terminal. In the client folder, activate vue:

> $ npm run serve

To test if the app is working fine, point your browser at http://localhost:8080. You should see:
